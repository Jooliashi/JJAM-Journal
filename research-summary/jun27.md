## Research conducted
- Main task for the day was to meet with Daniel and get him up to speed with our project narrative

## Questions
- From Daniel: how does each deployed review app interface with any databases that production code typically would?
  - Our answer: the application code needs to make API calls
- Do we as the review app provider need to make any distinctions between staging and production databases?

##  Todos/Next Steps
- Research any lingering implications around connecting to databases via APIs
- Walk through our current architecture diagram using a user story like "the user logs in and is taken to a page using server-side-rendering"
