## Presentation progress
- Further refined narrative/existing solutions portion of presentation based off feedback from yesterday's meeting with Daniel in regards to talking points that needed to be clarified and additional diagrams  
- Worked on short blurb description for Bubble in order to fill out intro section a bit more
- Worked on additional slides post-existing solutions section and up to architecture portion where we introduce Bubble's key features
  - We currently have a draft of a full demo of all commands and actions Bubble is capable of, but will be discussing what parts we feel are most important to actually demo during the presentation, and editing/splitting up the demo videos from there
- Did a test run of first half of presentation in preparation for our cross-mentor meeting with Elizabeth tomorrow
  - In doing this test run, we identified select areas where talking points could be cut down or animations could potentially be added to keep visual interest for slides that take a bit longer to talk through
  - Worked on refining transitions and ensuring each slide flows smoothly into the next

## Todos
- Finalize narrative/existing solutions/Bubble feature intro sections of presentation based off feedback from dry-run with Elizabeth tomorrow
- Work on architecture portion/latter half of presentation
