## Implementation/writeup conducted 
- continued working on ui
- progress on build logs:
  - Successfully found the runner id for deployment workflow for use in another workflow.
  - However, having trouble actually adding the log data to DynamoDB due to its size
  - decided to timebox it to a few more hours then pull the plug if it is not done by the start of next week
  - Another challenge that came up was removing special characters inserted by Github into the logs
- Continued to flesh out write-up, editing and answering each other's questions

##  problems collected and Todos
- UI will need to include the build logs once they are stored in Dynamo
- Todo: README (mostly framework, dashboard can be very minimal and just refer back to the framework)
- Continue working on writeup
