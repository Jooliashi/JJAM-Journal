## research conducted (refer to google doc Project Narrative Outline)
-   took a look at the project proposal example and tried to build our narrative to be close to that format
-   tried to find more real world example that support review app/staging environment for frontend applicationd deployment
-   made a comparison table for all the review as a service applications, also commonly called EaaS

## problems collected
-  are staging environment necessary to begin with?

## general thoughts/impressions of the problems
-  read through a few articles on companies using feature flag to roll out deployment rather than having a staging environment. Believe there is different use cases and trade offs for each scenario.

## Useful conversation notes:
On why staging environment and the issues with it

##  Todos
-   reconfirm our use case with Max
-   research more about alternative approaches to a staging environment
