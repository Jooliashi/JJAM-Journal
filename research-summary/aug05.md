## Presentation Progress
- Changed Where to Build narrative

## Meeting Notes
 Daniel notes 8/5
Build server vs GitHub Actions: version 3! Keep it simple (YAAAAAY!!! ðŸŽ‰)

Containers vs serverless functions: Can keep framing the trade-off as-is: simpler deployment (and reliable starts) vs longer build time, added cost (can assume it's always running) 

Build Log Challenge:
Maybe a visual with the graphics something like "development time," "storage cost," etc
Rather than "development time," as the downside frame it as another feature we have to support along with engineering complexity
