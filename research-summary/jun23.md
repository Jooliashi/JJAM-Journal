## Research conducted
-   started researching architecture of existing solutions we potentially want to model off of
-   started brainstorming requirements for a Minimum Viable Product and prototyping what the architecture may look like. To start:
  -   looked into options for how we can integrate with GitHub such that each pull request triggers a new build of the app
    -    played around with GitHub Apps and GitHub Actions to get a better sense of what it's like to use them and pros/cons of each

## Questions
- Choosing between GitHub Apps vs. GitHub Actions, what would be the implications and limitations of using one or the other in terms of our project's features/support level/use case?

##  Todos/Next Steps
-   continue prototyping/diagramming architecture for our MVP
-   continue looking at solutions in the space, and getting hands-on experience with various implementation options/tools to help inform our architectural decisions
-   narrow down target user characteristics further if needed as we start to get a better idea of what our architecture will look like
